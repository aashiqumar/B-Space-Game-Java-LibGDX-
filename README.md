B SPACE

An game which was created by me in order to learn the technology regarding game development. The game is created using LibGDX and Java to work across multiple operating systems. The game is a basic 2D game where a space ship will shoot all other enemy spaceships. 

Used Technologies :

1. LibGDX
2. Java
3. Androdi SDK

Supported Operating Systems :

1. Android
2. iOS
3. Mac OS
4. Windows OS

The App is currently under very early stages of development and no proper use or release of this publicly in the meantime. A new version would be developed soon in order program all the missing features across the Game.
